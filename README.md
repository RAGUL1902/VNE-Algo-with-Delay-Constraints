# VNE-Algo-with-Delay-Constraints
Implementing an efficient algorithm with delay constraints for virtual network embedding problem.

There are multiple files that is needed to implement the given paper.

Files and their description is listed below:

1. **simulation.py** - Calls basic functions to create topology, visualize the network
2. **visualize_virtual_network.py** - Uses networkx library, to generate image of topology
3. **virtual_network.py** - generates the virtual network with nodes and links all nodes.
4. **substrate_network.py** - generates the substrate network with nodes and links all nodes.
5. **compute_noderank.py** - computes node rank of values using bandwidth.
6. **subdivide_graph.py** - divides the graph into k sub divisions.
